						<h4>Test Doubling</h4>
						For a very detailed explanation read <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html" target="_blank">Mocks Aren't Stubs</a>.<br><br>
						Obviously in shell scripts we will not use objects in the traditional sense of OOP, but still implementing mock or fake values will go a long way for tests that can go deep in the code, without making changes in live systems.
					</section>
					<section>
						In this example "some_command" will read the fake file and after some operations it should export the value "expected" into $ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE.
						<pre class="bash"><code>
testCommandWithFile() {
  . some_command /testdirectory/mock/FAKE_FILE >/dev/null 2>&1
  assertEquals "expected" "$ENVIRONMENT_VALUE"
  return 0
}
						</code></pre>
						Ideally we will provide a file with content structured the same way as real data we want to process and know the expected result value.<br>
						For an example how to loop through several lines and perform the same test look at "examples/mailcheck/email_validity.test".

					<h4>Code Coverage</h4>
					The base assumption here is, that with a high coverage of your code with tests, you can be sure that it will work as intended.<br><br>
					As such this assumption is wrong, as of course the quality of the tests dictates how many real errors will be caught early on.<br><br>
					For more details see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage" target="_blank">Code Coverage on Wikipedia</a>.<br><br>
					There are several tools available,<br>known to work with shunit2 are bashcov and kcov.

						<h4>Naming Conventions</h4>
						Even though a variable name could be conceived as just an arbitrary placeholder and using anything like A, B, C, V1, V2 or I-have-data is just fine it becomes much more useful when used as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic" target="_blank">mnemonic</a> value.<br><br>
						This means a coder or a team will reflect certain logical elements within variable names and will opt for a certain writing style.<br><br>
						For a great overview of different naming convention styles see <a href="https://devopedia.org/naming-conventions">https://devopedia.org/naming-conventions</a>.<br><br>
					</section>
					<section>
						Some key points about naming conventions:
						<ul>
							<li>Never underestimate the time that is saved by improved readability!</li>
							<li>When working on a defined product or within a team, you should have them.</li>
							<li>It is fine to refine the usage via tribal knowledge e.g. within code reviews.</li>
							<li>Bad naming conventions can ruin your mood!</li>
						</ul>
