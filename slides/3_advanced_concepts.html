						<h4>Test Doubling</h4>
						For a very detailed explanation read <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html" target="_blank">Mocks Aren't Stubs</a>.<br><br>
						Obviously in shell scripts we will not use objects in the traditional sense of OOP, but still implementing mock or fake values will go a long way for tests that can go deep in the code, without making changes in live systems.
					</section>
					<section>
						In this example "some_command" will read the fake file and after some operations it should export the value "expected" into $ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE.
						<pre class="bash"><code>
testCommandWithFile() {
  . some_command /testdirectory/mock/FAKE_FILE >/dev/null 2>&1
  assertEquals "expected" "$ENVIRONMENT_VALUE"
  return 0
}
						</code></pre>
						Ideally we will provide a file with content structured the same way as real data we want to process and know the expected result value.<br>
						For an example how to loop through several lines and perform the same test look at "examples/mailcheck/email_validity.test".

					<h4>Code Coverage</h4>
					The base assumption here is, that with a high coverage of your code with tests, you can be sure that it will work as intended.<br><br>
					As such this assumption is wrong, as of course the quality of the tests dictates how many real errors will be caught early on.<br><br>
					For more details see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage" target="_blank">Code Coverage on Wikipedia</a>.<br><br>
					There are several tools available,<br>known to work with shunit2 are bashcov and kcov.
